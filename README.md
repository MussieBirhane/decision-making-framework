# decision-making-framework

The construction industry is the main contributor to global greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions, resource consumption and demolition-related waste generation.

A reduction in these environmental impacts can be achieved by recovering
building waste through selective deconstruction and material reuse.

The built environment can take advantage of circular economy and digitalization
principles to promote reuse practices. However, the absence of an established
decision-making framework to identify reusable structural elements and the lack
of initiatives to adopt advanced technologies for reuse
slow down the practical implementation in the built environment.

In this repository, a multi-criteria decision-making framework is developed
with an automated convolutional neural network (CNN) tool that recognizes
corrosion, connection types and associated damage from steel structure images,
with an overall accuracy of 83%, 89%, and 83%,
respectively.

The framework refers to the feasibility of decisions around reusing structural elements
from 2D end-of-life buildings images. Furthermore, this framework is intended to
 provide a strong supportive system to the stakeholders and
decision-makers in the built environment.

the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. The method developed in this
thesis can also be extended to other building types to further facilitate the reuse of components
and materials widely used in the industry.
